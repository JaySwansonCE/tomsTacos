1. Created Git Repo
#Also add .gitignore
	#files in .gitignore:
		#.DS_Store
		#yourenvname

2. Created a virtual environment:


virutalenv tacosEnv
source tacosEnv/bin/activate
pip freeze > requirements.txt




conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda  #This took a little while. It creates an environment with python, pip, and easy-install

source activate yourenvname  #active virtual environment

source env/bin/activate #adds shortcut so we don't have to type the "env/bin/" everytime


#THIS DEACTIVATES#
deactivate  #deactivate virtual environment
##


3. Track virtualenv additions:

pip freeze > requirements.txt  #Keeps track of packages installed in virtual environment

4. Downloads
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install html5lib
pip install requests
